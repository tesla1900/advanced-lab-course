ABSTRACT = {Micro-optical gyroscopes (MOGs) are a type of high-accuracy gyroscope, which have the advantages of miniaturization, low cost, and satisfactory operating power. The quality factor (Q) of the waveguide ring resonators (WRRs) is very important to the performance of MOGs. This paper reviews various MOGs using WRRs made from different materials, including silica, indium phosphide, calcium fluoride, and polymer WRRs. The different architectures of the MOGs are reviewed, such as double-ring resonator MOGs and multiple-ring resonator MOGs. Candidate high-Q WRRs for MOGs, including silicon nitride, lithium niobite, calcium fluoride, and magnesium fluoride WRRs, are also reviewed. The manufacturing process, Q, and integration density values are compared. Summarizing the advanced WRRs and calculating the shot-noise-limited sensitivity are helpful processes in selecting suitable materials to fabricate MOGs.},

abstract={The Sagnac effect is usually considered as being a relativistic effect produced in an interferometer when the device is rotating. General relativistic explanations are known and already widely explained in many papers. Such general relativistic approaches are founded on Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP), which states the equivalence between the gravitational ``force'' and the pseudo-force experienced by an observer in a non-inertial frame of reference, included a rotating observer. Typically, the authors consider the so-called Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric and the path of light is determined by null geodesics. This approach partially hides the physical meaning of the effect. It seems indeed that the light speed varies by {\$}{\$}c{\backslash}pm {\backslash}omega r{\$}{\$}in one or the other direction around the disk. In this paper, a slightly different general relativistic approach will be used. The different ``gravitational field'' acting on the beam splitter and on the two rays of light is analyzed. This different approach permits a better understanding of the physical meaning of the Sagnac effect.},

ABSTRACT = {Gyroscopes merit an undeniable role in inertial navigation systems, geodesy and seismology. By employing the optical Sagnac effect, ring laser gyroscopes provide exceptionally accurate measurements of even ultraslow angular velocity with a resolution up to 10−11 rad/s. With the recent advancement of ultrafast fibre lasers and, particularly, enabling effective bidirectional generation, their applications have been expanded to the areas of dual-comb spectroscopy and gyroscopy. Exceptional compactness, maintenance-free operation and rather low cost make ultrafast fibre lasers attractive for sensing applications. Remarkably, laser gyroscope operation in the ultrashort pulse generation regime presents a promising approach for eliminating sensing limitations caused by the synchronisation of counter-propagating channels, the most critical of which is frequency lock-in. In this work, we overview the fundamentals of gyroscopic sensing and ultrafast fibre lasers to bridge the gap between tools development and their real-world applications. This article provides a historical outline, highlights the most recent advancements and discusses perspectives for the expanding field of ultrafast fibre laser gyroscopes. We acknowledge the bottlenecks and deficiencies of the presented ultrafast laser gyroscope concepts due to intrinsic physical effects or currently available measurement methodology. Finally, the current work outlines solutions for further ultrafast laser technology development to translate to future commercial gyroscopes.},

abstract={The Continuous Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Campaign 2017 (CONT17) was observed from November 28 to December 12, 2017 and featured three independent observing networks. Two legacy S/X networks of nominally 14 stations each observed in parallel for the full 15 days of the campaign. One of them was made possible in large part by the participation of the ten-station very long baseline array network of the long baseline observatory. Furthermore, for the 5-day period from December 4 to 8, 2017, a six-station broadband network continuously recorded VLBI global observing system data. The different networks will help probe the accuracy of the VLBI estimates of the Earth orientation parameters and investigate possible network biases. We describe the organizational efforts undertaken to realize CONT17, including the analysis of resources such as recording media, electronic data transfer, and correlation, the assignment of stations to the three networks, and source selection and schedule writing.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Conference Series},
	abstract = {The Gross Ring G is a square ring laser gyroscope, built as a monolithic Zerodur structure with 4 m length on all sides. It has demonstrated that a large ring laser provides a sensitivity high enough to measure the rotational rate of the Earth with a high precision of ΔΩE < 10-8. It is possible to show that further improvement in accuracy could allow the observation of the metric frame dragging, produced by the Earth rotating mass (Lense-Thirring effect), as predicted by General Relativity. Furthermore, it can provide a local measurement of the Earth rotational rate with a sensitivity near to that provided by the international system IERS. The GINGER project is intending to take this level of sensitivity further and to improve the accuracy and the long-term stability. A monolithic structure similar to the G ring laser is not available for GINGER. Therefore the preliminary goal is the demonstration of the feasibility of a larger gyroscope structure, where the mechanical stability is obtained through an active control of the geometry. A prototype moderate size gyroscope (GP-2) has been set up in Pisa in order to test this active control of the ring geometry, while a second structure (GINGERino) has been installed inside the Gran Sasso underground laboratory in order to investigate the properties of a deep underground laboratory in view of an installation of a future GINGER apparatus. The preliminary data on these two latter instruments are presented.}
