            We investigated the hyperfine splitting of the $^{57}$Fe using the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect that allows 
            recoilless emission and absorption of photons. A $^{57}$Co source was placed with a moving 
            absorber, and the counts corresponding to the 14.4 keV transition of $^{57}$Fe was measured. The 
            obtained spectrum yielded more peaks than desired, which were attributed to the Iron (III) oxide
            from oxidation of the absorber. The linewidth obtained was an order of magnitude larger than the natural 
            linewidth, caused by temperature broadening. The g-factor from the hyperfine spectrum for both excited and ground 
            states were determined, yielding $| g_\mathrm{exc} | = 0.0992 \pm 0.0031$ and $| g_\mathrm{gr} | = 0.1809 \pm 0.0056$
            respectively. The g-factor of the ground state was in excellent agreement with the expected value, while those for the 
            excited state yielded poor agreement, attributing to the asymmetry in the distribution. We obtained the 
            isomer shift as $\delta = \num[scientific-notation=true]{0.1026(31)e-7}\si[]{\electronvolt}$, which indicates a deviation in 
            excited and ground state monopole energies.

\chapter{Introduction}

In this experiment, the phenomenon known as the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect is studied by means of transition spectroscopy. Using a $^{57}$Co source, this effect is observed and the hyperfine structure of 14.4 keV transition in $^{57}$Fe is measured. 

From the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum measured, we can see the isomeric shift, quadrupole and magnetic splitting of energy levels. Using this, one can determine the $g$-factor of the ground state and the first excited state.

In today's report, we will first discuss the theoretical background in Chapter \ref{sec:theory}. In this section we go through the principles of the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect, which gives us on insight on how the isomer shift, the electric quadrupole interaction and the magnetic dipole interaction give us the observed M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum. Then in Chapter \ref{sec:experiment}, we look at the experimental set-up used in order to perform the experiment and get the data. In Chapter \ref{sec:calibration}, we look at the decay spectrum of $^{57}$Fe, and find the region of interest, which is the M\"o{\ss}bauer line corresponding to 14.4 keV energy difference. 

In Chapter \ref{sec:moess}, we look at the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum for absorber moving Left-to-Right (LR) and Right-to-Left (RL), relative to the source for different relative velocities. This allows us to look at the Doppler shift, the isomeric shift and the hyperfine splitting in the energy levels. We also determine the $g$-factor for the separation of lines between the first excited state and the ground state. 


\chapter{Theoretical Background} \label{sec:theory}
In the following section, we shall study the theoretical background of the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect in brief. A much more detailed discussion can be found in \cite{Schatz1996}, mostly on which the following section is based.

\section{Principles} \label{sec:principles}

Let's take two atoms. If one of the atom's nucleus emits a photon and goes from an excited to a ground state, one might assume that the other nucleus can absorb this photon because the excitation energy of both the nuclei is the same. But that is not the case, since energy is lost by the radiated photon because of the recoil of the nucleus, just like a gun recoils when a bullet is fired. In 1957, R. M\"o{\ss}bauer found that this energy reduction in the emitted photon can be reduced if the atom is part of the bigger crystalline structure. In such a situation, the recoil momentum is transferred to the crystal as a whole, which is much more massive than the atom itself and hence the recoil energy is negligible. The recoilless emission and absorption of $\gamma $-radiation by the nucleus of an atom is known as the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect \cite{Schatz1996}. This effect can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:moess}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{moessbauer-effect}
    \caption{The recoilless emission and absorption of photon (M\"o{\ss}bauer effect).}
    \label{fig:moess}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Natural Linewidth}
The uncertainty in energy in the case of recoilless emission is limited by its natural linewidth. From the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we know that 

\begin{equation}
		\Delta E \Delta t = \hbar,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E $ is the energy difference, $\Delta t$ is the time difference and $\hbar $ is the reduced Planck's constant. In our case, if we have a nuclear level with a mean lifetime of $\tau _{N}$, the energy uncertainty is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:uncertainty}
		\Gamma = \hbar / \tau _{N}.	
\end{equation}

The frequency spectrum given by this emitted $\gamma$-ray is given by a Lorentz distribution, 

\begin{equation}
		I (\omega) = \frac{I_{0}}{1 + [2 \hbar (\omega - \omega_{0})/\Gamma]^2}
\end{equation}
where $I(\omega)$ is the intensity of the radiation at frequency $\omega$. The distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:lorentz}) is centered at $\omega_{0}$ and has a halfwidth of $\Gamma / \hbar $. For $^{57}$Fe used in this experiment, $\Gamma = 4.7 \times 10^{-9}$ eV. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{lorentz}
    \caption{Intensity distribution of emitted $\gamma$-ray, centered at $\omega_{0}$ with a halfwidth of $1 / \tau _{N}$.}
    \label{fig:lorentz}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Recoil and Doppler Shift}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:principles}, the recoil of the nucleus when emitting a $\gamma$-ray leads to a reduced energy. This can be written as

\begin{equation}
		E_{\mathrm{before}} = E_{e} + \frac{p^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where, $p$ is the momentum and $M$ is the mass of the nucleus. Energy after the emission can be written as

\begin{equation}
		E_{\mathrm{after}} = E_{g} + \frac{(p - \hbar k)^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar k$ is the momentum of the emitted $\gamma$-ray. The energy difference is 

\begin{equation}
		E_{\mathrm{before}} - E_{\mathrm{after}} \equiv \hbar \omega = \hbar \omega_{0} + \hbar (k \cdot v) - \frac{\hbar ^2 k^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where the term $\hbar (k \cdot v)$ is the Doppler effect, which is responsible for shift and broadening of the spectra. At room temperature, the Doppler shift for $^{57}$Fe is $\propto 10^{-2}$. The recoil energy $\hbar ^2 k^2 / 2M$ is $2 \times 10^{-3}$ eV, both of which are orders of magnitude greater than the natural width. The absorption and emission frequency spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:doppler}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{doppler}
    \caption{Emission and absorption spectrum of a monoatomic gas in thermal equilibrium. Both the spectra are shifted by the recoil energy and have been broadened due to Maxwell velocity distribution.}
    \label{fig:doppler}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Debye-Waller Factor}
In a typical tightly bound solid, the energy required to displace an atom from its position is 20 eV. Since the recoil energy of the $\gamma$-ray is of the order $10^{-3}$ eV, there are two possibilities that can occur. One, since the atom cannot be displaced, it is set in a vibrational motion. Or second, if the vibrational motion is not altered by the emission, the recoil energy is absorbed by the entire solid. In a typical solid, the mass of the entire crystal is $10^{20}$ times more than the mass of the atom and hence the recoil energy is negligible. In this case, we get an unshifted, unbroadened, emission (M\"o{\ss}bauer) line. 

The Debye-Waller factor ($f(T)$) is defined is the ratio of the unshifted $\gamma$-ray emission to the total number of emissions. This ratio is dependent on temperature and is the highest at $T = 0 \si{\kelvin}$. But even at absolute zero, $f < 1$. This is because of zero-point energy. 

In order to understand the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect better, one needs to understand the Debye-Waller factor. Because this factor shows us why the M\"o{\ss}bauer fraction is large. Since the quantum mechanical derivation is a bit too complicated, we look at the semi-classical approach to gain an intuition behind the Debye-Waller factor.

\subsubsection{The Semiclassical Approach of the Debye-Waller Factor}
Let us consider a nucleus, continuously emitting an electromagnetic wave of frequency $\omega_{0} = E_{\gamma}/\hbar $ and oscillating around an equilibrium point. Considering only one vibration frequency $\Omega$, which corresponds to the Einstein model of the oscillations. The electric field of the emitted radiation is given by

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:emission}
		E(t) = E_{0} \exp\left(- i [\omega_{0} t + k x(t) ] \right),
\end{equation}
where $x(t) = a \sin (\Omega t)$, $a$ is the amplitude of the oscillation. Decomposition of this relation in Eqn. \ref{eqn:emission} shows that, the effect of vibration of the atom reduces the intensity of the central line by a factor of ($1 - k^2 a^2 / 4$) and also produces sidebands with frequencies $\omega_{0} \pm \Omega$, $\omega_{0} \pm 2 \Omega$, .... 

If we sum up these contributions to the intensity from sidebands to the unshifted line, we get

\begin{equation}
		A(\omega_{0}) = 1 - \frac{k^2 a^2}{4} + ... = \mathcal{J}_{0} (ka),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{J}_{0} (ka)$ is the Bessel function of zero order. The Debye-Waller factor is given by the absolute square of this quantity. 

So far we have considered only a single oscillation mode. When we consider several normal modes (phonons), in which each frequency produces its own sidebands, we need to take the product of all of them (Eqn. \ref{eqn:product}). 

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:product}
		f = \prod \mathcal{J}_{0}^2(ka_{n}) \approx \prod \left( 1 - \frac{k^2 a^2}{4}\right)^2 \approx \exp \left(- k^2 < x^2 > \right),   
\end{equation}
where $< x^2 > = \sum_{}^{} a_{n}^2 / 2$ is the average square displacement. For an isotropic, 3-dimensional oscillator, 

\begin{equation}
		f = \exp \left( - \frac{k^2 < u^2 >}{3} \right),
\end{equation}
where $< u^2 > = 3 < x^2 >$, the average square displacement. In quantum mechanics, this $< u^2 >$ becomes the expectation value.

Going back to the Einstein model, where only single vibration frequency $\Omega $ is considered, we can derive the temperature dependence for the Debye-Waller factor. The harmonic energy with $n$ excited quanta is taken, the occupation probability is calculated and we find that the Bose-Einstein distribution function is obtained. Using this result, we then generalize for a phonon distribution function $Z(\Omega )$ and calculate the dependence for 3-dimensions. The result we obtain is

\begin{equation}
		f(T) = \exp \left( - \frac{\hbar k^2}{6 M N } \int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \frac{Z(\Omega )}{\Omega } \left[ 1 + \frac{2}{\exp(\hbar \Omega / k_{b} T) - 1 } \right] d \Omega \right),
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of molecules in the solid. 

The following important conclusions can be deduced: 
\begin{enumerate}
		\item By measuring the Debye-Waller factor, one can obtain the phonon frequency spectrum.
		\item The Debye-Waller factor decreases with increase in the recoil energy.
		\item Large M\"o{\ss}bauer effect can be observed at low temperatures, which is because of the fact that the Debye-Waller factor is maximum at absolute zero. Hence, low temperatures are favorable for measurement.
\end{enumerate}

\section{M\"o{\ss}bauer Source}

There are several requirements for a M\"o{\ss}bauer source. These are: 

\begin{enumerate}
		\item The $\gamma$-ray transition must go to the ground state, since for a stable isotope, absorption can only take place from the ground state.
		\item The Debye-Waller factor must not be too small. In order to achieve that, we must have low temperatures, low $\gamma$-ray energy, high Debye temperature and high atomic mass.
		\item The lifetime should not be too short, otherwise due to Eqn. \ref{eqn:uncertainty}, we will have a poor energy resolution.
		\item The source should be practical (easy to obtain, handle and so on).
\end{enumerate}

There are several possible sources for studying the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect, many of these are discussed in detail in \cite{Schatz1996}. In this experiment, we used isotope $^{57}$Co as the source. The decay scheme is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:decay}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{source}
    \caption{Decay scheme of $^{57}$Co. The decay occurs largely (99.8\%) due to Electron Capture (EC). The nuclear moments of M\"o{\ss}bauer level (I = 3/2) and ground level (I = 1/2) are shown here.}
    \label{fig:decay}
\end{figure}	

The M\"o{\ss}bauer source $^{57}$Co-$^{57}$Fe is an ideal choice because the parent isotope, $^{57}$Co has long halflife (270 days), which enables one to perform several experiments with the same source. The lifetime of the M\"o{\ss}bauer level is sufficiently long, giving us a good energy resolution. Lastly, the energy level of 14.4 keV is small enough to allow for the conduction of experiment at room temperature. 

\section{M\"o{\ss}bauer Apparatus and Setup}

A schematic representation of the setup is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:setup}. Here, we have a radioactive source, an absorber and a detector. In the diagram, the source is moving with respect to the absorber but in our setup, the source was stationary and the absorber was moving. This doesn't really change anything, since the relative motion is constant. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{setup}
	\caption{A representation of the setup of the experiment. In our case, the absorber moves while the source remains stationary. The Doppler principle is seen by the scanning of the absorption line with the emission line. The resultant intensity is proportional to the addition of absorption and emission lines, which are marked at four arbitrary chosen velocities between $u_{1}$ and $u_{4}$ \cite{Kuzmann2011}.}
    \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

There are two possible arrangements: transmission geometry and scattering geometry. In  transmission geometry, we record the intensity of $\gamma$-rays transmitted. While in scattering geometry, the fluorescence radiation is measured. In order to achieve the resonance condition (similar to what can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:setup}), we move the absorber relative to the source (or vice versa). A loudspeaker principle is often used to produce these oscillations. On these oscillations, velocity profiles can be imposed by using driver coils, using a function generator. 

The $\gamma$-ray detector is often made of scintillators or gas-filled proportional counters. These detect the intensity of $\gamma$-rays that pass through the absorber. The pulse height that we get with a proportional counter with 97\% Kr and 3\% CO$_2$, is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:pulse-height}. The line corresponding to 14.4 keV is the M\"o{\ss}bauer line. This is the region that we study in the experiment in order to get the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{pulse-height}
    \caption{Pulse height spectrum measured using gas-filled proportional counter. The 14.4 keV M\"o{\ss}bauer line is shown. \cite{Schatz1996}.}
    \label{fig:pulse-height}
\end{figure}

The absorber velocity is varied from 0 mm/s to 6 mm/s. The counts for the $\gamma$-rays are recorded separately for when it is moving Left-to-Right (LR), N(LR) and when it is moving Right-to-Left (RL), N(RL). Depending upon the direction of motion of the absorber, the detector pulses are fed into the signal-channel-analyzer into their respective counters. At the same time, the respective timers feed their information into the counters of their respective channel, T(LR) or T(RL). The number of turns made by the absorber can be read off from the run counter. The total swing of the device is 25.1mm. 

\section{Isomer Shift}

A shift in the resonance of the spectrum occurs in the M\"o{\ss}bauer experiment due to difference in the monopole energy in the ground state and excited state. The monopole energy is given by

\begin{equation}
		E_{c} = \frac{Z e^2}{6 \epsilon_{0}} \left| \Psi(0) \right|^2 <r^2>,
\end{equation}
where $<r^2>$ is the mean square radius of the nuclei. 

For a moving absorber, the energy difference between excited (e) to ground state (g) is given by

\begin{equation}
		\hbar \omega (A) = \hbar \omega _{0} \left( 1 + \frac{v}{c} \right) + \frac{Z e^2}{6 \epsilon_{0}} \left| \Psi_{A}(0) \right| ^2 (<r_{e}^2> - <r_{g}^2> ),
\end{equation}
where the first term corresponds to Doppler shift due to the motion of the absorber. For a stationary absorber, 

\begin{equation}
		\hbar \omega (S) = \hbar \omega _{0} + \frac{Z e^2}{6 \epsilon_{0}} \left| \Psi_{S} (0) \right| ^2 ((<r_{e}^2> - <r_{g}^2> ).
\end{equation}

For the resonance condition to be fulfilled, $\omega (S) = \omega (A)$, the velocity of the absorber must be

\begin{equation}
		v_{res} = \frac{Z e^2 c}{6 \epsilon_{0} \hbar \omega _{0}} \left( \left| \Psi_{A} (0) \right|^2 - \left| \Psi_{S} (0) \right| ^2 \right) \left( <r_{e}^2> - < r_{g}^2 > \right), 
\end{equation}
where $v_{res}$ is the isomer shift. By convention, this value is positive when the absorber is moving near the source. For $^{57}$Fe, this value is negative since the radius of the nuclei in the excited state is smaller than the of ground state. Typically, the order of isomer shift is of the order of several mm s$^{-1}$. 

\section{Electric Quadrupole Interaction}

Electric quadrupole interaction occurs in the presence of electric field gradient, which leads to non-spherical nucleus when the nuclear spin I $\geq$ 1. In this case the degeneracy of the $m$ sublevels is lifted and we get a splitting of energy levels. As can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:quadrupole}, the energy level splitting does not depend on the sign of $m$, $m = \pm 3 / 2$ are indistinguishable.    

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{quadrupole}
    \caption{Quadrupole splitting of I = 3/2 and the corresponding M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum \cite{Kuzmann2011}.}
    \label{fig:quadrupole}
\end{figure}

The energy separation that can be seen Fig. \ref{fig:quadrupole}, is given by

\begin{equation}
		\Delta E = 6 \hbar \omega _{Q} = \hbar \omega _{0} \frac{\Delta v}{c},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta v$ is the separation in between two lines in velocity spectrum, it is given by

\begin{equation}
		\Delta v = \frac{eQV_{zz}c}{2 \hbar \omega _{0}}.
\end{equation}

In the case of powder sample of $^{57}$Fe, we get equal amplitude of M\"o{\ss}bauer lines. This is because the electric field gradient are distributed statistically, which leads to the $\gamma$-rays being emitted isotropically. 

\section{Magnetic Dipole Interaction}

Magnetic dipole interaction leads to further splitting in the energy levels of the sublevels. This is a result of magnetic interaction ($- \mu \cdot B$) splitting the magnetic sublevels equally, consequently splitting the energy levels of the emitted $\gamma$ radiation. Fig. \ref{fig:dipole} shows the magnetic splitting for $^{57}$Fe. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{dipole}
    \caption{The magnetic splitting of energy levels and the corresponding M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum of $^{57}$Fe \cite{Kuzmann2011}.}
    \label{fig:dipole}
\end{figure}

Experimentally, only six lines are transitions are observed and therefore we can conclude that this follows the m1 selection rules, according to which no m cannot be greater than one. The transition energies are given by

\begin{align}
		\hbar \omega (m_{e} \rightarrow m_{g})  &= \left(E_{e} - \frac{\mu_{e}}{I_{e}} m _{e} B \right) - \left( E_{g} - \frac{\mu _{g}}{I_{g}}m _{g} B \right) \\
												&= \hbar \omega _{0} - \left(\frac{\mu _{e}}{I_{e}} m _{e} - \frac{\mu _{g}}{I_{g}}m _{g} \right) B.
\end{align}

The resonant velocity is given by

\begin{equation}
		v_{res} = - \frac{c}{\hbar \omega _{0}} \left(\frac{\mu _{e}}{I_{e}} m _{e} - \frac{\mu _{g}}{I_{g}} \mu _{g} \right) B.
\end{equation}

The magnetic hyperfine structure can be given by

\begin{equation}
		H = - \mu \cdot B = -g \mu _{N} I B,
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the magnetic moment and  $\mu _{N}$ is the nuclear nuclear magneton \cite{Kuzmann2011}. Since the magnetic energy is given by $E_{m} = g \mu _{N} M B$, the energy perturbation due to hyperfine splitting is given by 

\begin{equation}
		E_{m} = - g \mu _{N} B.
        \label{eq:hyperfine_en}
\end{equation}


\chapter{Experimental Set-Up} \label{sec:experiment}

To measure the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum, we placed a $^{57}$Co radioactive source onto a table with a moving absorber 
that has a maximum displacement of $\SI[]{25.1 \pm 0.2}[]{\milli\metre}$.  A photodetector is placed 
behind the absorber that detects the number of photons that are not absorbed via this process. The speed of the 
absorber is controlled by a motor that swings the absorber at a fixed velocity. See Fig. \ref{fig:apparatus_source}
for the M\"o{\ss}bauer source apparatus. \par 

\begin{figure*}[htb!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{source_image.png}

	\caption{The set-up of the M\"o{\ss}bauer source. \textit{Left}: The $^{57}$Co source. \textit{Middle}: 
	The moving absorber. \textit{Right}: The photodetector which is connected to the detector apparatus.
	}
	\label{fig:apparatus_source}
\end{figure*}

The photodetector is then connected to a single channel analyzer (SCA), which determines the number of counts detected
in a given time range and maximal and minimal width to observe the counts. The SCA has 2 main parameters that should be modified:
the Upper Level Discrimator (ULD) and the Lower Level Discrimator (LLD), which controls the binsize and the lower limit for 
photodetection respectively. The modes of the ULD can be set to measure with a higher resolution by detecting counts with 
10 $\%$ of the binsize. The SCA was then connected to a display in which the number of counts obtained in a specific time 
interval was shown. \par 

The photodetecting apparatus consisted of two such setups to consider for measurements with positive and negative velocity 
of the absorber as the offset voltage between the two can allow the measurements in the LR and RL direction to differ.
A separate run counter that tracks the number of turns that the absorber had is also contained in the apparatus. A timer 
that controls the time interval of measurement is also placed which is used for the calibration process. The set-up is 
constructed in a way such that the count and time measurements terminate only after the absorber had performed a full turn. 
See Fig. \ref{fig:apparatus_raw} for the apparatus used for the photodetection as well as the schematic of the apparatus. \par

\chapter{Calibration} \label{sec:calibration}

Before we took any measurements, we determined the optimal values for the LLD in order to ensure that we are 
detecting counts from the 14.4 keV transition. In order to do so, we modified the LLD from 0 to 4 and determined the number 
of counts obtained at each value for a fixed time interval for $T = \SI{10}{\second}$. Once the data was obtained, 
we plotted the number of detected photons $N$ against the LLD values and compared our results to the $^{57}$Fe $\gamma$-spectrum as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pulse-height}.
This allowed us to identify the range in which we should set the ULD and LLD values when performing the M\"o{\ss}bauer measurements. 
 Fig. \ref{fig:calibration_plot} shows the obtained spectrum from our experiment. See the Appendix section for the full data obtained from this 
 section. The uncertainty for the counts were taken to be purely statistical such that $\delta N = \sqrt{N}$, and the uncertainty 
 of the time interval measurement was taken to be $\delta T = \pm \SI{0.003}{\second}$. \par

\end{figure*}

By comparison to expected results, we identified the 14.4 keV transition line as the third peak on Fig. \ref{fig:calibration_plot}. 
The ULD and LLD values that were used to perform the M\"o{\ss}bauer measurement was then set to be 1.8 and 2.6 respectively. \par 

% add something about how we used fit to get the true values for the LLD values (if we do)?

\chapter{M\"o{\ss}bauer Spectrum} \label{sec:moess}

\section{Spectrum}

To observe the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum, we first set the ULD and LLD to 1.8 and 2.6 respectively as obtained from Chapter \ref{sec:calibration}. 
Once a certain motor speed has been set, we ran both LR and RL single channel analyzer for a set number of turns, ranging from 4 to 10
turns. We then recorded the obtained number of counts and duration for both LR and RL analyzers. This was repeated until we obtained 
enough points to more accurately construct the M\"o{\ss}bauer peaks. This was verified by using the built-in plotting tool in Excel where we 
displayed the plot between the count rate $R = N / T$ against the motor speed. We took a total of 60 measurements in this experiment, ranging for 
motor speeds from 0 to 2.5. Fig. \ref{fig:moess_raw} shows the raw data obtained from both analyzers. See Appendix (Chapter \ref{sec:Appendix}) for the raw data table obtained from both analyzers. \par 

\begin{figure*}[htb!]

	\caption{The Raw Spectrum obtained from the M\"o{\ss}bauer measurement for the 14.4 keV transition for $^{57}$Fe from the (a) LR and (b) RL 
	single channel analyzer. Several outliers can be observed.}
	\label{fig:moess_raw}
\end{figure*}


The uncertainty of the count rate was calculated using the standard Gaussian error propagation formula using $\delta N$, $\delta T$ 
as in Chapter \ref{sec:calibration}:
\begin{equation}
	\delta R = R \sqrt{\left(\frac{\delta N}{N}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right)^2} = R \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{N}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right)^2} .
\end{equation} \par 


To determine the peaks, we first filtered out the outliers from the data, then combined the LR and RL measurements to construct 
the full M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum. Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect_filt} shows the combined M\"o{\ss}bauer measurement after filtering. \par 

\begin{figure*}[htb!]

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{moess_spect_filt.png}
	\caption{The M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum after removing outliers and combining the LR and RL data.}
	\label{fig:moess_spect_filt}
\end{figure*}


We then performed a non-linear fit to the multi-Lorentzian distribution, i.e. the sum of Lorentzian
distributions, to determine the peak velocity $v_0$, peak amplitude $I_0$, and the full-width half-maximum of the peaks (FWHM) $\Gamma_v$ for each observed peak. The 
offset $\delta_I$ from a full symmetric distribution was also determined through this fitting process. The equation used to fit
is shown as such:
\begin{equation}
    I_{tot}(v, v_{0_i}, I_{0_i}, \Gamma_{v_i}, \delta_I) = \delta_I + \sum \limits_{i=1}^{N_{\mathrm{peaks}}} - I_{0_i} \frac{(\Gamma_{v_i} / 2)^2}{(v - v_{0_i})^2 + (\Gamma_{v_i} / 2)^2}
    \label{eq:multi_lorentzian}
\end{equation}
The fitting procedure was implemented using the Python package \texttt{lmfit} which utilizes the Levenberg-Marquardt method. 

Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect} shows the full Moessbauer spectrum with the obtained multi-Lorentzian fit, and Table \ref{tab:fit_params} shows the obtained fit parameters from the analysis for each peak.
The offset was determined to be $\delta_I = \SI{3.162 \pm 0.025}{\per\second} $. We also show the spectrum against the individual Lorentzian
peaks that composed our total fit in Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect_comps}. The uncertanties were obtained from the 
covariance matrix evaluated through the fitting procedure. Sec. \ref{sec:Appendix} shows the fit using the initial guess parameters. \par

% From Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect}, we observe eight prominent peaks. The six sharp peaks observe can be identified as the 
% spectrum due to the hyperfine splitting of the $^{57}$Fe atom through the 14.4 keV transition. This can be said as the nearest
% two peaks have lower peak amplitudes compared to the other observed peaks with a difference of $\sim 0.15$ compared to its
% closest peaks. Their linewidth is also much larger than the rest, where the 4th peaks has a linewidth greater than 1. 
% These unphysical peaks may have been caused by the temperature fluctuations and instrumentation error associated with the 
% equipment. \par 

From Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect}, we observe a total of eight peaks, contrary to the 
six peaks that are expected from the hyperfine splitting of the $^{57}$Fe spectrum. After calculating for the isomer shift and 
g-factors in the following sections, we observed that the first and last peaks were outliers that may have not have been a result of  
 the 14.4 keV transition of $^{57}$Fe. 
A possible explanation of the additional peaks is due to the oxidation of the absorber. As the instrument may be relatively old,
the iron may have oxidized, creating impurities within the absorber. The oxidation of the iron will have caused some of the iron
to iron(III) oxide, containing Fe$_2$O$_3$, FeO, and Fe$_3$O$_4$. When performing M\"o{\ss}bauer spectroscopy onto such molecules, 
one observes finer splitting at absorber velocities of around $6-8\si[]{\milli\metre\per\second}$, which is what we also 
observe from Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect} \cite{Winsett2019}. As of such, we removed the first and last peaks for the following 
sections. \par 

\section{Natural Linewidth}

To compare the obtained peaks to the analytical results from the hyperfine splitting of the $^{57}$Fe nucleus through the 14.4 keV
transition, we convert the fit parameters described in the absorber velocity into the transition energy $E_\gamma$ using the 
equation describing the Doppler shift of the ground state energy: 
\begin{equation}
    E = E_0 \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right) \implies E_\gamma = \Delta E = E_0\frac{v}{c}
\end{equation}
where $E_0$ is the expected ground state energy $E_0 = \SI{14.4}{\kilo\electronvolt}$. The FWHM were converted in a similar 
fashion. Table \ref{tab:energy_params} shows the energy value $\Delta E$ and its 
FWHM $\Gamma$ for each observed peak.

\label{tab:energy_params}
\end{table}

We then evaluated the average linewidth and its corresponding error using the weighted mean as such: 
\begin{equation}
    \Gamma_{\mathrm{avg}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{peaks}} \Gamma_i \delta\Gamma_i^{-2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{peaks}} \delta\Gamma_i^{-2}}
    \quad \delta \Gamma_\mathrm{avg} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N_\mathrm{peaks}} \delta\Gamma_i^{-2}\right)^{-1}}
    \label{eq:linewidth_avg}
\end{equation}
where the $1 / 2$ is incorporated as the linewidth is defined as half of the FWHM of the peak. 

Using Eq. \ref{eq:linewidth_avg}, we obtained an average linewidth of $\Gamma_{\mathrm{avg}} = \num[{scientific-notation = true}]{14.28(90)e-9}\si{\electronvolt}$. 
Comparing this to the natural linewidth of the 14.4 keV transition of $\Gamma_0 = \SI{4.7e-9}{\electronvolt}$, we observe that the linewidths we obtained are an 
order of magnitude larger. A possible cause for this may be due to the Doppler broadening that is caused by the temperature in the room
in which the experiment was conducted in. This is due to the fact that at high temperature the vibrations of the atoms within both the source and 
the absorber yield larger uncertainties in the transition energies of the $^{57}$Fe nucleus. In the future, this experiment should be 
conducted in a colder environment to reduce such broadening.\par 

\section{Hyperfine Splitting}

Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect} show the multiple peaks that correspond to the hyperfine splitting through electric quadrupole and 
magnetic dipole transitions of the $^{57}$Fe nucleus. As the spectrum splits both at the excited state and at the ground state, we evaluated
the g-factor for both the excited and ground state which we denote as $g_{\mathrm{exc}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{gr}}$ respectively. \par

We use Eq. \ref{eq:hyperfine_en} to determine the g-factor using the magnetic field of the nucleus of $H = \SI{33.3 \pm 1.0}{\tesla}$ as given in Ref. \cite{k2212016}
and the nuclear magneton as $\mu_N = \SI{3.152e-8}{\electronvolt\per\tesla}$:
\begin{equation}
    g = \frac{\Delta E}{\mu_N H}
    \label{eq:hyperfine_gfac}
\end{equation}

In order to use this equation, we first determined the energy values between the peaks. For the excited states, we compare between the 
peaks that induce the same transition, i.e. the difference of energy values between each peak. The peak-to-peak difference between the 
two middle peaks (peaks 4 and 5) were omitted as they do not represent transitions through excited states. Table \ref{tab:hyperfine_exc_en} shows the energy values between such peaks.  

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
        Peaks & $\Delta E_\mathrm{exc}$ [$\SI{1e-7}{\electronvolt}$] \\ \hline
        2 - 3 & $1.037 \pm 0.015$ \\ \hline
        3 - 4 & $1.070 \pm 0.069$\\ \hline
        5 - 6 & $1.047 \pm 0.017$ \\ \hline
        6 - 7 & $1.039 \pm 0.014$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Peak-to-peak energy values, corresponding to energies for hyperfine splitting in the excited state. The peaks are 
    defined as with before.}
    \label{tab:hyperfine_exc_en}
\end{table}

From this, we obtain a weighted average excited transition energy of $\Delta E_\mathrm{exc, avg} = (1.0413 \pm 0.0089)\times 10^{-7} \si[]{\electronvolt}$ 
using the weighted average formula similarly to Eq. \ref{eq:linewidth_avg}. Using Eq. \ref{eq:hyperfine_gfac}, we obtain a g-factor for the excited state as $| g_\mathrm{exc} | = 0.0992 \pm 0.0031$.
This yields values that are $2.19\sigma$ values away from to the expected value of 
the g-factor of the excited state $| g_\mathrm{exc, thr} | = 0.106$ \cite{VANIN2007}. This indicates that our obtained 
values are in not in good agreement with the expected value.\par 

To find the corresponding g-factor of the ground state, we first determine the energy values between peaks from the $+v$ and $-v$
directions, i.e. those in each symmetric distribution. This yields the total transition energy due to the 
splitting of both excited and ground states. The energy difference due to the hyperfine splitting of the ground state is then obtained by 
subtracting the contribution from the average excited state energy obtained above, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \Delta E_{\mathrm{gr}} = \Delta E_{\mathrm{exc + gr}} - \Delta E_{\mathrm{exc}} . 
\end{equation}
Table \ref{tab:hyperfine_gr_en} shows the ground state transition energies for each peak. 

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
        Peaks & $\Delta E_\mathrm{exc + gr}$ [$\SI{1e-7}{\electronvolt}$] & $\Delta E_\mathrm{gr}$ [$\SI{1e-7}{\electronvolt}$]\\ \hline
        2 - 5 & $2.934 \pm 0.020$ & $1.885 \pm 0.028$\\ \hline
        3 - 6 & $2.944 \pm 0.011$ & $1.895 \pm 0.022$\\ \hline
        4 - 7 & $2.913 \pm 0.071$ & $1.864 \pm 0.073$\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Same as Table \ref{tab:hyperfine_exc_en} but for the ground state. The total excitation energy is also shown.}
    \label{tab:hyperfine_gr_en}
\end{table}

From Table \ref{tab:hyperfine_gr_en}, we obtained the weighted average ground state splitting energy $\Delta E_{\mathrm{gr, avg}} = \num[scientific-notation=true]{1.899(12)e-7}\si{\electronvolt}$, 
which gives us a g-factor of $| g_\mathrm{gr} | = 0.1809 \pm 0.0056$. Comparing with the expected value of $| g_\mathrm{gr, thr} | = 0.181$, 
we observe that our results is $0.18\sigma$ values away, which indicates excellent agreement \cite{VANIN2007}.\par 

We observe that while we obtain excellent agreement with the ground state g-factor, we do not obtain good results for the excited 
state g-factor. A possible cause of this may be due to the asymmetry in the distribution. We observe that Peak 4 has much larger 
broadening compared to other peaks, which may cause deviation in the peak energy. In the future, more datapoints should be taken in 
regions where peak values are located to obtain an even better resolution for the measurement.

\section{Isomer Shift}

We measure the isomer shift by taking the energy difference between the pair of similar peaks obtained from the $+v$ and $-v$
directions, i.e. the furthermost peaks, the middle peaks, and the two innermost peaks. As the spectrum is ideally symmetric, 
by observing the deviation from the two peaks, we observe the deviation of the difference from the zero value. This will yield the 
desired isomer shift. Table \ref{tab:isomer_en} shows the resulting values for each pair of peaks. 

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
    \hline
        Peaks & $\Delta E_\mathrm{pair}$ [$\SI{1e-7}{\electronvolt}$] \\ \hline
        2 - 7 & $0.1012 \pm 0.0059$ \\ \hline
        3 - 6 & $0.1037 \pm 0.0036$ \\ \hline
        4 - 5 & $0.080 \pm 0.024$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{The energy difference between each similar pair of peaks, which is used to determine the isomer shift.}
    \label{tab:isomer_en}
\end{table}

We then obtained the isomer shift by taking the weighted average of the energy difference values. From this, we yielded
$\delta = \num[scientific-notation=true]{0.1026(31)e-7}\si[]{\electronvolt}$, indicating a clear difference in the 
energies of the ground and excited state of the electric monopole. \par 

\chapter{Conclusion and Outlook}

In this paper we investigated the hyperfine structure of the $^{57}$Fe decay
 at the 14.4 keV transition energy utilizing the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect. The M\"o{\ss}bauer effect
 allows the recoil energy of the atom due to the emission or absorption of the radiated
 photon to be neglected by moving the source or absorber of the photons. This allows measurements 
 up to the order of $\SI{1e-9}{\electronvolt}$ and thus can observe phenomena which requires 
 precision such as the isomer shift and the hyperfine splitting of the nuclei. \par
 
 In our experiment, a $^{57}$Co source was placed near a moving $^{57}$Fe absorber, and the transmission 
 of photons through the absorber was measured using a single channel analyzer. The setup was 
 first calibrated so that only counts resulting from the 14.4 keV M\"o{\ss}bauer transitions are obtained when 
 performing the measurement. This was performed by varying the channel parameter to obtain the 
 $\gamma$-spectrum of $^{57}$Fe and identifying the peak that corresponds to the 14.4 keV transition. \par 

 The absorber was then set to various velocities and the corresponding counts were measured. 
 After removing outliers from the measurement, we obtained the desired M\"o{\ss}bauer
 spectrum for $^{57}$Fe. Two additional peaks were observed, but we considered them as outliers 
 that possibly originate from the iron oxide that is formed from oxidation of the iron. \par
 
 The corresponding spectrum was then fitted using a sum of Lorentzian 
 functions, and from this we obtained the amplitudes, peak energies, and linewidths of 
 each peak. We obtained a linewidth of $\Gamma_{\mathrm{avg}} = \num[{scientific-notation = true}]{14.28(90)e-9}\si{\electronvolt}$,
 which is an order of magnitude larger than the natural linewidth. This is expected due to 
 Doppler broadening due to temperature fluctuations \par
 
To determine the g-factor of the excited and ground state, the peak-to-peak energy was obtained. 
For the excited state, the energy difference between each peak was taken, and with the given
magnetic field we obtained our g-factor to be $| g_\mathrm{exc} | = 0.0992 \pm 0.0031$, which is
$2.7\sigma$ away from the expected value. For the ground state, the excited state energy was 
subtracted from the energy difference between every third peak, yielding a g-factor of $| g_\mathrm{gr} | = 0.1809 \pm 0.0056$.
The results obtained for the ground state were $0.18\sigma$ away, indicating excellent agreement. This deviation
was attributed to the asymmetry between the left and right side of the distribution. \par 

To determine the isomer shift, the energy difference between pairs of peaks were taken, yielding 
$\delta = \num[scientific-notation=true]{0.1026(31)e-7}\si[]{\electronvolt}$. The large isomer shift
indicates that there are large deviations between the monopole energy of the ground and excited state. \par 

In the future, we can obtain finer measurements for the spectrum, which would yield 
in a more precise spectrum. Further, multiple measurements should be taken for each point, which 
will reduce the statistical uncertainty. This project can be extended by observing the temperature 
dependence of the Debye-Walle factor or comparing the spectrum between different M\"o{\ss}bauer sources.
