\chapter{Introduction}

In this experiment, the phenomenon known as M\"o{\ss}bauer effect. is studied by means of transition spectroscopy. Using a $^{57}$Co source, this effect is observed and the hyperfine structure of 14.4 keV transition in $^{57}$Fe is measured. 

From the M\"o{\ss}bauer spectrum of measured, we can see the isomeric shift and quadrupole and magnetic splitting of energy levels. Using this, one can determine the $g$-factor of the ground state and the first excited state can be determined. 

\chapter{Theory}
In the following section, we shall study the theoretical background of the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect in brief. A much more detailed discussion can be found in \cite{Schatz1996}, mostly on which the following section is based.

\section{Principles} \label{sec:principles}

Let's take two atoms. If one of the atom's nucleus emits a photon and goes from an excited to a ground state, one might assume that the other nucleus can absorb this photon because the excitation energy of both the nuclei is the same. But that is not the case, since energy is lost by the radiated photon because of the recoil of the nucleus, just like a gun recoils when a bullet is fired. In 1957, R. M\"o{\ss}bauer found that this energy reduction in the emitted photon can be reduced if the atom is part of the bigger crystalline structure. In such a situation, the recoil momentum is transferred to the crystal as a whole, which is much more massive than the atom itself and hence the recoil energy is negligible. The recoilless emission and absorption of $\gamma $-radiation by the nucleus of an atom is known as the M\"o{\ss}bauer effect \cite{Schatz1996}. This effect can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:moess}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{moessbauer-effect}
    \caption{The recoilless emission and absorption of photon (M\"o{\ss}bauer effect).}
    \label{fig:moess}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Natural Linewidth}
The uncertainty in energy in the case of recoilless emission is limited by its natural linewidth. From the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, we know that 

\begin{equation}
		\Delta E \Delta t = \hbar,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta E $ is the energy difference, $\Delta t$ is the time difference and $\hbar $ is the reduced Planck's constant. In our case, if we have a nuclear level with a mean lifetime of $\tau _{N}$, the energy uncertainty is given by

\begin{equation}
		\Gamma = \hbar / \tau _{N}.	
\end{equation}

The frequency spectrum given by this emitted $\gamma$-ray is given by a Lorentz distribution, 

\begin{equation}
		I (\omega) = \frac{I_{0}}{1 + [2 \hbar (\omega - \omega_{0})/\Gamma]^2}
\end{equation}
where $I(\omega)$ is the intensity of the radiation at frequency $\omega$. The distribution (Fig. \ref{fig:lorentz}) is centered at $\omega_{0}$ and has a halfwidth of $\Gamma / \hbar $. For $^{57}$Fe used in this experiment, $\Gamma = 4.7 \times 10^{-9}$. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{lorentz}
    \caption{Intensity distribution of emitted $\gamma$-ray, centered at $\omega_{0}$ with a halfwidth of $1 / \tau _{N}$.}
    \label{fig:lorentz}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Recoil and Doppler Shift}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:principles}, the recoil of the nucleus when emitting a $\gamma$-ray leads to a reduced energy. This can be written as

\begin{equation}
		E_{before} = E_{e} + \frac{p^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where, $p$ is the momentum and $M$ is the mass of the nucleus. Energy after the emission can be written as

\begin{equation}
		E_{after} = E_{g} + \frac{(p - \hbar k)^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where $\hbar k$ is the momentum of the emitted $\gamma$-ray. The energy difference is 

\begin{equation}
		E_{before} - E_{after} \equiv \hbar \omega = \hbar \omega_{0} + \hbar (k \cdot v) - \frac{\hbar ^2 k^2}{2M},
\end{equation}
where the term $\hbar (k \cdot v)$ is the Doppler effect, which is responsible for shift and broadening of the spectra. At room temperature, the Doppler shift for $^{57}$Fe is $\propto 10^{-2}$. The recoil energy $\frac{\hbar ^2 k^2}{2M}$ is $2 \times 10^{-3}$ eV, both of which are orders of magnitude greater than the natural width. The absorption and emission frequency spectrum is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:doppler}.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{doppler}
    \caption{Emission and absorption spectrum of a monoatomic gas in thermal equilibrium. Both the spectra are shifted by the recoil energy and have been broadened due to Maxwell velocity distribution.}

\chapter{Experimental Set-Up}

To measure the Moessbauer spectrum, we placed a Co-57 radioactive source onto a table with a moving absorber 
that has a maximum displacement of $\SI[]{25.1 \pm 0.2}[]{\milli\metre}$.  A photodetector is placed 
behind the absorber that detects the number of photons that are not absorbed via this process. The speed of the 
absorber is controlled by a motor that swings the absorber at a fixed velocity. See Fig. \ref{apparatus_source}
for the Moessbauer source apparatus. \par 

\begin{figure*}[htb!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{source_image.png}

	\caption{The set-up of the Moessbauer source. \textit{Left}: The Co-57 source. \textit{Middle}: 
	The moving absorber. \textit{Right}: The photodetector which is connected to the detector apparatus.
	}
	\label{fig:apparatus_source}
\end{figure*}

The photodetector is then connected to a single channel analyzer (SCA), which determines the number of counts detected
in a given time range and maximal and minimal width to observe the counts. The SCA has 2 main parameters that should be modified:
the Upper Level Discrimator (ULD) and the Lower Level Discrimator (LLD), which controls the binsize and the lower limit for 
photodetection respectively. The modes of the ULD can be set to measure with a higher resolution by detecting counts with 
10 $\%$ of the binsize. The SCA was then connected to a display in which the number of counts obtained in a specific time 
interval was shown. 
The photodetecting apparatus consisted of two such setups to consider for measurements with positive and negative velocity 
of the absorber as the offset voltage between the two can allow the measurements in the LR and RL direction to differ.
A separate run counter that tracks the number of turns that the absorber had is also contained in the apparatus. A timer 
that controls the time interval of measurement is also placed which is used for the calibration process. The set-up is 
constructed in a way such that the count and time measurements terminate only after the absorber had performed a full turn. 
See Fig. \ref{fig:apparatus_raw} for the apparatus used for the photodetection as well as the schematic of the apparatus. \par

% \section{Procedure}

% \subsection{Calibration of SCA}
\chapter{Calibration} \label{sec:calibration}

Before we took any measurements, we determined the optimal values for the LLD in order to ensure that we are 
detecting counts from the 14.4 keV transition. In order to do so, we modified the LLD from 0 to 4 and determined the number 
of counts obtained at each value for a fixed time interval for $T = \SI{10}{\second}$. Once the data was obtained, 
we plotted the number of detected photons $N$ against the LLD values and compared our results to the Fe-57 $\gamma$-spectrum as seen in Fig. \hl{add reference here}.
This allowed us to identify the range in which we should set the ULD and LLD values when performing the Moessbauer measurements. 
 Fig. \ref{fig:calib_plot} shows the obtained spectrum from our experiment. See the Appendix section for the full data obtained from this 
 section. The uncertainty for the counts were taken to be purely statistical such that $\delta N = \sqrt{N}$, and the uncertainty 
 of the time interval measurement was taken to be $\delta T = \pm \SI{0.003}{\second}$. \par

\begin{figure*}[htb!]
	\centering

	\caption{The pulse height spectrum for Fe-57 decay observed in the experiment. The number of counts are shown for varying 
	LLD values.
	}
	\label{fig:calib_plot}
\end{figure*}

By comparison to expected results, we identified the 14.4 keV transition line as the third peak on Fig. \label{fig:calib_plot}. 
The ULD and LLD values that were used to perform the Moessbauer measurement was then set to be 1.8 and 2.6 respectively. \par 

% add something about how we used fit to get the true values for the LLD values (if we do)?

\chapter{Moessbauer Spectrum}

\section{Procedure and Results}

To observe the Moessbauer spectrum, we first set the ULD and LLD to 1.8 and 2.6 respectively as obtained from Chapter \ref{sec:calibration}. 
Once a certain motor speed has been set, we ran both LR and RL single channel analyzer for a set number of turns, ranging from 4 to 10
turns. We then recorded the obtained number of counts and duration for both LR and RL analyzers. This was repeated until we obtained 
enough points to more accurately construct the Moessbauer peaks. This was verified by using the built-in plotting tool in Excel where we 
displayed the plot between the count rate $R = N / T$ against the motor speed. We took a total of 60 measurements in this experiment, ranging for 
motor speeds from 0 to 2.5. Fig. \ref{fig:moess_raw} shows the raw data obtained from both analyzers. See Appendix (Chapter \ref{sec:Appendix}) for the raw data table obtained from both analyzers. \par 

\begin{figure*}[htb!]
	\centering
	\subfloat[]{{\includegraphics[width=0.45\columnwidth]{raw_moess_LR.png}}}

	single channel analyzer. Several outliers can be observed.}
	\label{fig:moess_raw}
\end{figure*}


The uncertainty of the count rate was calculated using the standard Gaussian error propagation formula using $\delta N$, $\delta T$ 
as in Chapter \ref{sec:calibration}:
\begin{equation}
	\delta R = R \sqrt{\left(\frac{\delta N}{N}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right)^2} = R \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{N}}{N}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\delta T}{T}\right)^2} .
\end{equation} \par 


To determine the peaks, we first filtered out the outliers from the data, then combined the LR and RL measurements to construct 
the full Moessbauer spectrum. We then performed a non-linear fit to the multi-Lorentzian distribution, i.e. the sum of Lorentzian
distributions, to determine the peak velocity $v_0$, peak amplitude $I_0$, and uncertainty $\Gamma_v$ for each observed peak. The 
offset $\delta_v$ from a full symmetric distribution was also determined through this fitting process. This was done using the built-in
function \texttt{scipy.optimize.curve\_fit} that utilizes the least-squares method. Fig. \ref{fig:moess_spect} shows the full Moessbauer
spectrum with the obtained Lorentzian fit. Table  shows the obtained fit parameters from the analysis. \par
