abstract="M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy, based on the recoilless resonance emission and absorption of $\gamma$ photons observed with certain atomic nuclei, is a powerful investigating tool in most disciplines of natural science ranging from physics to chemistry to biology. This nuclear method makes it possible to measure the energy difference between nuclear energy levels to an extremely high resolution (up to 13--15 decimals). This resolution is required to measure the slight variation of nuclear energy levels caused by electric monopole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic dipole interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. M{\"o}ssbauer nuclides being at different microenvironments act as local probes for the sensitive detection of the hyperfine interactions. Such interactions reflect changes in the electronic, magnetic, geometric, or defect structure as well as in the lattice vibrations, serving as a basis for a variety of applications. In this chapter, the principles and some practical aspects of M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy are described.",
