\section{Introduction}



\section{Theory}


\section{Waveguides}
In order to understand cavities, we start off with the discussion on waveguides.
An electromagnetic wave, when confined to the interior of a hollow pipe is
called a waveguide. We shall closely follow the derivation from \cite{}.The
generalized Maxwell equations in terms of E-field and H-field are given by:

\begin{align}
		\curl {\vb{{E}}} &= - \pdv{{B}}{t} \\
		\div{\vb{D}} &= \rho \\
		\curl {\vb{{H}}} &= \vec{j} + \pdv{{D}}{t} \\
		\div{\vb{{B}}} &= 0 
\end{align}

In vacuum, these equations become: 
\begin{align}
		\curl {\vb{{E}}} &= \mu_0 \cdot \pdv{{H}}{t} \\ 
		\div{\vb{{E}}} &= 0 \\
		\curl {\vb{{H}}} &= \epsilon_{0} \cdot \pdv{{E}}{t} \\
		\div{\vb{{H}}} &= 0
\end{align}

Upon solving these equations, we get plane wave solutions which looks like this: 
\begin{align*}
		\Delta \vec{E}\left(\vec{r}\right) + \frac{\omega}{c^2} \vec{E}\left(\vec{r}\right) = 0 \\
		\Delta \vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) + \frac{\omega}{c^2} \vec{B}\left(\vec{r}\right) = 0 
\end{align*}

Now, let us look at a waveguide which is aligned along the z-direction. Taking
the ansatz $\vec{E} = \vec{E}(x,y).e^{i(\omega t -kz)}$ and the separation
$\Delta = \Delta_{\perp} + \pdv[2]{}{z}$, for the longitudinal fields yields: 

\begin{align}
		\Delta_{\perp}E_{z} + k_{c}^2 E_{z} = 0 \\
		\Delta_{\perp}H_{z} + k_{c}^2 H_{z} = 0 
\end{align}
where 
\[
		k_{c}^2 = \frac{\omega^2 }{c^2 } - k^2   
\]
The quantity $k_{c} $ is called the critical wave number and is a characteristic
property of the cavity, as we shall see. Solving these equations further, we see
that it is sufficient to know the longitudinal fields, $E_{z} $ and $B_{z} $
because we can easily determine the transverse components from them. 
\begin{align} 
		ik_{c}^2 \vec{E}_{\perp} = k \vec{\nabla}_{\perp}E_{z} + \omega \mu _{0} \vec{\nabla}_{\perp}H_{z} \times \hat{e}_{z} \label{trans1} \\
		ik_{c}^2 \vec{H}_{\perp} = k \vec{\nabla}_{\perp}H_{z} - \omega \epsilon_{0} \vec{\nabla}_{\perp} E_{z} \times \hat{e}_{z} \label{trans2}     
\end{align}

Now, there are two waves to classify these waves: 
\begin{enumerate}
		\item $k_{c}^2 = 0  $ 
				\begin{enumerate}
						\item $\vec{\Delta_{\perp} }E_{z}  \ne 0$ and
						$\vec{\Delta}_{\perp}H_{z} \ne 0  $: HE or EH hybrid
						waves.
						\item $\vec{\Delta_{\perp} }E_{z}  = 0$ and
						$\vec{\Delta}_{\perp}H_{z} = 0  $: TEM waves.
				\end{enumerate}
		\item $k_{c}^2 \ne 0  $ In this case we do not get any propagation if
		$\omega \leq c \cdot k_{c} $. These waves are called evanescent waves or
		the cut off condition. The possible propagation modes are: 
		\begin{enumerate}
				\item $E_{z}=0 $: TE (transversal electric) or H waves.
				\item $H_{z}=0 $: TM (transversal magnetic) or E waves.
		\end{enumerate}
		
\end{enumerate}

Corresponding to this critical wave, we have a critical frequency, which is
$\omega_{c}=k_{c}.c $, below which there is no propagation. One interesting
thing to note here is that for a hollow waveguide, only TE or TM modes are
possible, TEM is not, because no wave would exist in this case \cite{}. But for
a coaxial cable, which consists of straight wire surrounded by a conduction
sheath, we can get TEM modes.

\subsection{Cylindrical waveguides}
We now consider a cylindrical waveguide with an inner radius a. This imposes the
following boundary conditions to the walls of the waveguide:
\begin{itemize}
		\item $E_{\phi} = 0$, $E_{z} = 0 $ \text{for} $r = a$ 
		\item $H_{r} = 0 $ \text{for} $r = a$ 
\end{itemize}

The field distribution solution for a cylindrical waveguide can be separated
into angular and radial parts, whose solutions are then given by the
Bessel/Neumann functions. These can be then substituted in the
eq.(\ref{trans1})-(\ref{trans2}) and upon imposing the constraints from the
boundary condition gives us the corresponding TE- and TM-modes.

\subsection{Cylindrical waveguides resonator}
The time has now come, to talk about cavities itself. If we now insert two
conducting plates perpendicular to the z-axis, the incoming wave is reflected
completely, giving us standing waves. Because of this, the z-dependence changes
like: 

\[
		a \cdot e^{ikz} \implies A \cdot \sin\left(kz + \phi_{0}\right)    
\]
The following condition is imposed so that the longitudinal boundary conditions
are fulfilled: $k = p\cdot \pi /l $. The longitudinal field looks like: 
\begin{align*}
		\mathbf{TE_{mnp}-Modes}&: H_{z} = H_{mn}\cdot J_{m} \left(k_{c}r \right) \cos\left(m \phi \right) \cdot \sin\left(p \pi / l \cdot z \right) \cdot e^{\omega_{mnp}t}; \\  &\text{ where } k_{c}a=j_{mn}^{'}  \\
		\mathbf{TM_{mnp}-Modes}&: E_{z} = E_{mn}\cdot J_{m}^{'}  \left(k_{c}r \right) \cos\left(m \phi \right) \cdot \cos\left(p \pi / l \cdot z \right) \cdot e^{\omega_{mnp}t}; \\  &\text{ where } k_{c}a=j_{mn} 
\end{align*}
For resonant frequency, we have:

\[
		\omega_{mnp} = c \cdot \sqrt{\left(j_{mn}/a\right)^2 + \left(p \pi / l\right)^2} 
\]

Here, $J_{m}$ is the $m$-th Bessel function, $J_{m}^{'} $ is its derivative. And
$j_{mn}$ and $j_{mn}^{'}$ are the $n$-th zeropoints of the $m$-th Bessel
function and its derivative.

The resonant modes can be written in the linear form as:

\begin{equation}
		\left(d \nu \right)^2 = \left(\frac{cj_{mn}^{(')}}{\pi}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c}{2}\right)^2 p^2 \left(\frac{d}{l}\right)^2
\end{equation}

here $d$ is the diameter of the cavity. When we plot different modes on a graph,
we get a mode map (Fig.\ref{fig:mode}). The mode map allows one to read off the
resonant frequencies for different diameters and length of the cavity. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{mode_map}
    \caption{Mode map for $p \leq 2$ \ref{} }
    \label{fig:mode}
\end{figure}

Since the derivative of the zeroth order Bessel function and the first order
Bessel function, $j^{'}_{0n}$ and $j_{1n}$, are equal, the corresponding TE- and
TM-modes have the same resonant frequencies. That is, $TE_{0np}$-modes and
$TM_{1np}$-modes have the same resonant frequency. 

\section{Oscillating circuit}
A cavity has a lot of characteristic quantities, which can be described by an
equivalent circuit (Fig.\ref{fig:circuit}). 
\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{circuit}
    \caption{Equivalent circuit of a cavity with loop coupling}
    \label{fig:circuit}
\end{figure}	

Coupling is a process through which electromagnetic waves can be coupled to a
waveguide, or in this case, to a cavity. There are several ways to couple and in
this experiment, we use loop coupling, which enables coupling to the magnetic
field inside the cavity. In the figure \ref{fig:circuit}, the LCR-circuit
represents the cavity. The step-down transformer represents the loop coupling,
$Z_{0}$ is the characteristic impedance and $R_{s}$ is the Shunt impedance. 

The characteristic quantities associated with the cavity are:
\begin{itemize}
		\item Quality factor 
		\item Coupling coefficient 
		\item Reflection coefficient 
		\item Shunt impedance
\end{itemize}

Let us look at these quantities in a bit more detail. 

\subsection{Quality factor}
Quality factor is a dimensionless quantity which describes how underdamped an
oscillator or resonator is. It is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
		Q_{0} = \frac{2 \cdot \pi \text{stored energy} }{\text{losses per period}} = \frac{2 \pi \cdot W }{T\cdot P} =  \frac{\omega_{0}\cdot W}{P}
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{0}$ is the angular resonant frequency. Looking at the case of
driven oscillations, the unloaded quality factor can be determined from the Full
Width Half Maximum (FWHM), $\Delta \omega_{H}$

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:fwhm}
		Q_{0} = \frac{\omega_{0}}{\Delta \omega_{H}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Coupling coefficient}
The coupling coefficient is defined as:
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:coupling}
		\kappa = \frac{Z_{a}}{Z_{0}} = \frac{R_{s}}{n^2Z_{0}} = \frac{Q_{0}}{Q_{ext}}	
\end{equation}
<<<<<<< HEAD
where $n$ is the transformer turn ratio, $Q_{0}$ is the unloaded quality factor
and $Q_{ext}$ is the external quality factor.  
If we know the coupling coefficient, the unloaded quality factor can be
calculated using: 
\begin{equation}
=======
where $n$ is the transformer turn ratio, $Q_{0}$ is the unloaded quality factor and $Q_{ext}$ is the external quality factor. These values are related by the following relation: 

\[
		\frac{1}{Q} = \frac{1}{Q_{0}} + \frac{1}{Q_{ext}}
\]

If we know the coupling coefficient, the unloaded quality factor can be calculated using: 
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:quality}
>>>>>>> 3e9a66e (Should be done by tonight)
		Q_{0} = \left(1 + \kappa\right)\cdot Q
\end{equation}
\\
We also get 3 cases for the coupling coefficient, which are: 
\begin{itemize}
		\item $\kappa < 1$: undercritical coupling, $Q>Q_{0}/2$
		\item $\kappa = 1$: critical coupling, $Q = Q_{0}/2$ (no reflection)
		\item $\kappa > 1$: overcritical coupling, $Q<Q_{0}/2$ 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reflection coefficient}
In the conductor, we have an incoming wave ($\hat{U}_{+}, \hat{I}_{+}$) and
reflected wave ($\hat{U}_{-}, \hat{I}_{-}$). Hence we define the complex
reflection coefficient as:

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:refleccoeff}
		\rho = \frac{\hat{U}_{-}}{\hat{U}_{+}}
\end{equation}
<<<<<<< HEAD

The coupling coefficient and the reflection coefficient are related at resonance
by: 
=======
\\
The coupling coefficient and the reflection coefficient are related at resonance by: 
>>>>>>> 3e9a66e (Should be done by tonight)
\begin{equation}
		\kappa = \left|\frac{1 + \rho}{1 - \rho} \right| 
\end{equation}
\\
We shall discuss more about this in the next section.

\subsection{Shunt impedance}
Shunt impedance tells us how much energy is gained by a charged particle when it
crosses the cavity. It is defined by: 

\begin{equation}
		R_{s} = \frac{U^2}{2 P_{V}} = \frac{1}{P_{V}} \left|\int\limits_{L/2}^{-L/2} E_{0}\left(s \right) \cdot e^{i \omega_{0}s/c}\cdot ds \right|^2 
\end{equation}
\\
The impedance of the resonator in fig.\ref{fig:circuit} is a complex quantity. This value only becomes real at resonance and when it does, it is called the Shunt impedance. This value is typically of the order of $10^{6} \  \Omega$. This is the reason we use a step down transformer in the circuit, using loop coupling, as seen in Eq.(\ref{eqn:coupling}). 

\section{Scalar measurement of reflection coefficient}
The reflection coefficient we defined in the previous section (eqn. \ref{eqn:refleccoeff}) is a complex value. It looks like:

\[
		\rho(\Delta \omega) = \rho_{0} (\Delta \omega) \cdot e^{-2ikl} = \frac{\kappa - \left(1 + 2iQ_{0}\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega}\right)}{\kappa + \left(1 + 2iQ_{0}\frac{\Delta \omega}{\omega}\right)} \cdot e^{-2ikl}
\]
\\
We get this when we investigate only take $\Delta \omega \ll \omega_{0}$. When this reflection coefficient is measured some distance $l$ away from the cavity, we get the delay factor of $e^{-2ikl}$.
\\ \\
Now, we can separate the real and imaginary part and get its modulus: 

\begin{equation} \label{eqn:scalar}
			\left| \rho (\Delta \omega) \right| = \left| \rho_{0}(\Delta \omega) \right| = \sqrt{\frac{(\kappa - 1)^2 + 4Q_{0}^2 \left(\Delta \omega / \omega \right)^2}{(\kappa + 1)^2 + 4Q_{0}^2 \left(\Delta \omega / \omega \right)^2}} 
\end{equation}
\\
The scalar network analyzer should then look like fig. \ref{fig:scalar}.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{scalar}
	\caption{Reflection coefficient for different values of coupling coefficient and Quality factors along with FWHM ($\Delta \omega_{H}$). \cite{}}
    \label{fig:scalar}
\end{figure}

From the figure, we can see that the reflection is minimum at resonance. At resonance, the value of the reflection coefficient is given by:

\begin{equation}
		\left| \rho (\Delta \omega = 0) \right| = \left| \frac{\kappa - 1}{\kappa +1} \right| 
\end{equation}

The equation can be inverted to calculate the value of coupling coefficient. But one cannot distinguish between $\rho >0$ and $\rho<0$. 

In order to calculate the value of reflection coefficient at FWHM, we use the following relation (which one can derive by using eqn.(\ref{eqn:fwhm}), (\ref{eqn:quality}) and (\ref{eqn:scalar}):

\begin{equation}
		\left| \rho (\Delta \omega_{H}/2) \right| = \frac{\sqrt{\kappa^2 + 1} }{\kappa +1} 
\end{equation}

It is important to note that only the case of $\kappa = 1$ do we get the FWHM at $\rho = 1 / \sqrt{2} $. This is because of the way we define dB-values, which will be discussed in another section. \\
In all other cases, 

\[
		\left| \rho (\Delta \omega_{H}/2) \right| = \frac{\sqrt{\kappa^2 + 1} }{\kappa +1} \ne \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} } 
\]

\section{Vectorial measurement of reflection coefficient}
The vectorial reflection coefficient is given by: 

\begin{equation}
		\rho (\Delta \omega) = \frac{(\kappa - 1)^2 - 4Q_{0}^2 \left(\Delta \omega / \omega \right)^2 - 4i \kappa Q_{0} \Delta\omega / \omega}{(\kappa + 1)^2 + 4Q_{0}^2 \left(\Delta \omega / \omega \right)^2}  \cdot e^{-2ikl}
\end{equation}
\\
Neglecting the delay coefficient term, $e^{-2ikl}$, we get an equation, which when plotted on the complex plane (close to the resonance), $\rho_{0}$ describes a circle of radius r around ($x_{0}, y_{0}$).  The radius r is given by: 

\[
		r = \frac{\kappa}{1+ \kappa}
\]

We find that all the positions of circles are independent of quality factor and depend only on the coupling coefficient. Another interesting thing we find is that all these circles go through (-1, 0) (as shown in fig. \ref{fig:circles}). 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{circles}
	\caption{Different position and radii for different values of $\kappa$. \cite{}}
    \label{fig:circles}
\end{figure}

Now taking the delay coefficient into account, we see the circles rotate around the origin (fig. \ref{fig:delay}). For large values of quality factor, the distortion in the shape of the circle is negligible, but it is quite noticeable in low values of quality factor. We will be neglecting these distortions in our measurements because we such calibrations can be done only on expensive equipments. \\
In fig. \ref{fig:delay}, we also notice that we have an outer circle which is the reflection circle. It represents complete reflection of frequencies far away from the resonance one. The smaller circle is called the resonance circle. 

\begin{figure}[htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{delay}
	\caption{The delay coefficient rotates the circle around the origin. We can also see the Resonance and Reflection circle. \cite{}}
    \label{fig:delay}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Determining resonant frequency and coupling}

\section{Experimental Setup}

In our experiment, we used three cylindrical cavities, each with a length of
$L_{cav} = \SI{20}{\milli\metre}$ with an inner diameter of $d_{cav} =
\SI{78.5}{\milli\metre}$. The first and second cavity are completely sealed and
are free to move, but differ in their coupling position to the radio frequency.
The third cavity is open from the sides and is mounted on a rail, in which its
position can be freely adjusted and is displayed on an external device
digitally. The cavities used are shown in Fig. \ref*{fig:cavities_equipment}.

\begin{figure*}[hbt!]
	\centering
	\subfloat[\centering
	\label{fig:top_cavity}]{{\includegraphics[width=0.3\columnwidth]{cavity_top.jpg}}}
	\quad
	\subfloat[\centering
	\label{fig:mounted_side_cavity}]{{\includegraphics[width=0.6\columnwidth]{cavity_side_rail.png}}}

	\caption{The three cavities used in this experiment. (a): The cavity with
	top coupling. The connector that couples the radio frequency can be
	observed. (b) The cavity with side coupling (right) and the mounted cavity
	(left) \cite*{Switka22}. The detector used to measure the position of the
	mounted cavity is also shown.}
	\label{fig:cavities_equipment}
\end{figure*}

To measure the resonant frequencies, reflection coefficients, and other relevant
quantities in our experiment, we utilize a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) shown
in Fig. \ref*{fig:VNA}. The VNA generates a signal from its AC source and it is
transmitted through the coaxial cable connected to the ports of the VNA. The
resulting transmission or reflection of the signal is then shown on the display
as a function of the frequency of the signal (in Hz). The units displayed can be
altered between $U$, the ratio between output and input signal, and $dB = 20
\log_{10}(U)$. \par  

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{VNA.jpg}
	\caption{The Rhode \& Schwarz Vector Network Analyzer used in this experiment.}

	\label{fig:VNA}
\end{figure*}

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Attenuation and Reflection in Coaxial Cables}

As the coaxial cable connects the cavity to the VNA, we need to choose a cable
such that it does not interfere with the measurement of the cavity's response.
To determine the optimal coaxial cable to use, we thus measured the attenuation
and reflection of different coaxial cables at different frequency ranges. In our
experiment, this was done for the RG-142 and ST-18 cables with a length of
$l_{RG142}=\SI{51.02 \pm 0.10}{\centi\meter}$ and 
$l_{ST18}=\SI{182.55 \pm 0.10}{\centi\meter}$ respectively. \par

To measure the attenuation and reflection, we first calibrated the VNA to the
silver RG402 coaxial cable with a length of $l_{RG402} =
\SI{30.02 \pm 0.01}{\centi\meter}$. The calibration process was performed using a
full-two port calibration with the TOSM algorithm provided by the VNA. The open,
short, and load (with termination impedance of $\SI{50}{\ohm}$) at the two ports
(port 2 on the VNA and the coaxial cable) were then calibrated by utilizing the provided calibration kit
(Fig. \ref*{fig:calibration_kit}). 

\begin{figure*}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{calibration_kit.jpg}
	\caption{The open (left), short (middle) and load (right) used for 
			calibration in this experiment.}

	\label{fig:calibration_kit}
\end{figure*}

The attenuation of the signal was then measured by connecting the end of the
coaxial cable to the input port (port 2) on the VNA. We then connect the same load from the
calibration kit to the end of the coaxial cable to measure the reflection
coefficient. Both measurements were performed to verify that the VNA was
properly calibrated. \par 

After the calibration was performed with the silver cable, we connected the two
coaxial cables to the silver cable and measured their attenuation and reflection
coefficient by performing the same procedure as with the silver one. The raw
measurements obtained are shown in Fig.  \ref*{fig:calib_trans} and 
Fig. \ref*{fig:calib_refl}. The value at several frequencies were tabulated (and
were used to determine the attenuation of the cable. The attenutation was the
compared to those from given datasheets).
